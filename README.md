# JS-Format-Time
JS-Format-Time
Function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

·         HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99

·         MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

·         SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)
Instructions for better code:

1.      Use an online IDE and share the link to this thread for solution

2.      Do not use image of the code to share your code

3.      Provide the time and space complexity of your solution in the code comment

4.      Try to find a Linear time & space or better solution

5.      Add more tests cases including the edge cases for the problem

6.      Avoid nested loop
